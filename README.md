Created a Hotel Database with the ability to grow into a Review platform for patron who vist hotels. 
  The database allow users to create a hotel by name, url and description on the front end via create a hotel page. 
  You can view all hotels in the database on the homepage and click "View Hotel" Button to view more infomation about the hotel including 
  a picture which the user can upload. 
  
  Technical: React Redux, Javascript, CSS-styled.components for design. Rails API on the backend. 

The backend of my project is fully built out with the opportunity to grow using CRUD and also a Review Model, if the website 
can be use more that just display updating hotels.
